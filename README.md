# Next.js 15 App Router Dynamic Route Fallback: false Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15's App Router when using dynamic routes with `fallback: false`.  Even when the data for the dynamic route exists, the route is not found, resulting in a 404 error.

## Bug Description

The issue occurs when a dynamic route is defined with `fallback: false`, and the data for that route is available but the route is not found.  This is inconsistent with the expected behavior.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Navigate to a route that should exist (e.g., `/blog/post-1`).
5. Observe a 404 error. 

## Expected Behavior

The page should render successfully when the data for the dynamic route exists, even with `fallback: false`.

## Actual Behavior

A 404 error is returned, indicating that the route cannot be found.

## Solution

The solution is provided in the `bugSolution.js` file and involves adding proper data fetching mechanisms.
